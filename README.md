This repository contains a CSV file with dialogue lines. The script `generate_network.py` parses the file and produces a simple character relationship graph in SVG format.

## Usage

Run the following command to generate `relationship_graph.svg`:

```bash
python3 generate_network.py
```

The resulting SVG can be viewed in any web browser.
